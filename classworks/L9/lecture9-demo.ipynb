    "# Exercise 1: \"Private\" Methods and Names in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "We will consider two extensions to the real numbers:  complex numbers and dual numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Complex Numbers\n",
    "A complex number is defined as $$z = a + ib$$ where $i^{2} = -1$.  $a$ is the real part and $b$ is the imaginary part.  The polar form of a complex number is $$z = \\left|z\\right|e^{i\\theta}$$ where $\\left|z\\right|^{2} = zz^{*} = a^{2} + b^{2}$ and $z^{*} = a - ib$ is the complex conjugate of $z$.  The angle between $a$ and $b$ is given by $$\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dual Numbers\n",
    "The dual numbers look similar.  We have $$d = a + \\epsilon b$$ where $\\epsilon$ is a number (not zero!) such that $\\epsilon^{2} = 0$.  Once again $a$ is the real part, but here $b$ is the dual part.  The polar form of this number is $$d = \\displaystyle a\\left(1 + \\epsilon \\frac{b}{a}\\right).$$  Note that the magnitude of the dual number $\\left|d\\right| = a$ since $dd^{*} = \\left(a + \\epsilon b\\right)\\left(a - \\epsilon b\\right) = a$ where $d^{*} = a - \\epsilon b$ is the conjugate of $d$.  Finally, the angular part is $$m = \\dfrac{b}{a}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Dual numbers are a route to automatic differentiation.  We'll mention them again in the AD lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "For today, your task is to write a module called `mynumbers.py`.  The module should contain at a minimum the following:\n",
    "* A base class called `RealExtensions` with a constructor that accepts $a$ and $b$.\n",
    "* A subclass called `Complex` (inherits from `RealExtensions`) that has the following methods:\n",
    "  * Compute the magnitude of the complex number\n",
    "    * **Note:** This method should be preceeded by a single underscore to indicate that it should not be accessed by a user.\n",
    "  * Compute the \"angle\" of the complex number\n",
    "    * **Note:** This method should be preceeded by a single underscore to indicate that it should not be accessed by a user.\n",
    "  * Compute the polar form of the complex number using `_magnitude()` and `_angle()`\n",
    "* A subclass called `Dual` (inherits from `RealExtensions`) that has methods for computing the magnitude and \"angle\" of the dual number.\n",
    "  * Compute the magnitude of the dual number\n",
    "    * **Note:** This method should be preceeded by a single underscore to indicate that it should not be accessed by a user.\n",
    "  * Compute the \"angle\" of the dual number\n",
    "    * **Note:** This method should be preceeded by a single underscore to indicate that it should not be accessed by a user.\n",
    "  * Compute the polar form of the dual number using `_magnitude()` and `_angle()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of \"hiding\" the `magnitude()` and `angle()` methods may or may not be a good one.  The goal is to show that this is not really privacy; it's more of a contract between people using the code.  Note that a user can still access `_magnitude()` and `_angle()`.  However, this is a rather strong contract among Python programmers and is used widely in Python code.\n",

    "For some reason you decide to store the components of your number in an immutable data structure.  Do this in the base class (`RealExtensions`) via a tuple attribute called `number`. Provide a *method* called `number` in the `Complex` subclass which stores the number as a list in an attribute named `number`.  If the user calls the `number` method on a `Complex` instance, then you automatically store the number in an immutable data structure as specified in the base class constructor.  Use `super()` to call the base class constructor.  Meanwhile, still in the `number` method of the `Complex` subclass, store the mutable list of numbers as an attribute in the subclass.  Once again, name this attribute `number`.\n",

    "This exercise was meant to illustrate the mechanics of name mangling.  The idea of privacy via name mangling in Python is a bit controversial [Ian Bicking at Paste Style Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20161025185040/http://pythonpaste.org/StyleGuide.html)\n",
    ">Never, ever use two leading underscores. This is annoyingly private. If name clashes are a concern, use explicit name mangling instead (e.g., _MyThing_blahblah). This is essentially the same thing as double-underscore, only itâ€™s transparent where double underscore obscures.\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential use case is if a class is meant to be extended many times (see, e.g. [Why are Python's 'private' methods not actually private?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70528/why-are-pythons-private-methods-not-actually-private/70900#70900)).
